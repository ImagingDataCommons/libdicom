# TODO

- replace copy-paste code over types with a table
	dcm_element_clone()

- element->vr should be an enum (not "UL" etc.)
	- swap all the strcmps for ==

- use a table for dcm_element_create_* as well

- should create_element() take a size_t for length?

- remove dcm_dataset_copy_tags() etc should not use uint32_t? what about
  dcm_dataset_count()?

	get_num_frames() uses strtol(), so it's a long

  does utarray_len() really return uint32?

- dcm_dataset_print() should not use uint8_t

- should the foreach funcs take two params? are they used?

- wrappers for read() / seek() / etc. that include error checks 

  part of allowing your own read funcs

- call dcm_dataset_lock() everywhere, don't set lock by hand

- disable assert in production builds
	there's eg. assert_vr() too, check this
	what does DCM_DEBUG_ONLY() mean? is this sanity checking?

- have a thing to free an array of strings, plus the array eg.
	create_element_str_multi()

# Tips

- debug failing test with eg.

	CK_FORK=no CK_RUN_CASE=frame gdb ./check_dicom
